## TLDR
The AWS CLI can be used to create, change or delete ressources and services in AWS Via Command Line. Its often for automation purposes.

## Access Keys
- Authentification for CLI Commands 
- Can be generated by user for an [[IAM]] User and inherits that users permissions (the CLI will act as if was that user)
- Access Key ID: Username 
- Secret Access Key: PW
- Need to specifiy correct region
``` bash
# set access key once for all future CLI commands
aws configure 
```

- Avaiable for most common programming languages, also for Iot and mobile sdk

## Run Command
