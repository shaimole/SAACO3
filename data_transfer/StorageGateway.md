- Local cache for frequently accessed data
- Windows native compatiblity (SMB, NTFS, AD)
- Group file shares and home directories

### Volume Gateway
- Block Storage
- Backed by [[EBS]] snapshots

#### Cached volumes
- low latency access to most recent data

#### Stored volumes
- dataset on premise, backups are schedules to [[S3]]

### Tape Gateway
- uses Virtual Tape libray
- for backup processes using physical Tapes
- can send directly into [[S3]] Glacier

## Hardware appliance
