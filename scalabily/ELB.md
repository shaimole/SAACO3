# Elastic Load Balancer

## TLDR
AWS family of load balancers. Is used to spread and control traffic to a vertically scaled infrastructre.

## Features
- Server which forwands traffic to other servides (e.g. [[EC2]])
- spread load
- expose single dns access to whole clustered application
- seamlessly handle failures
- health checks
- provides https to instances
- enforce stickyness with cookies
- high availabliy across zones
- separate public traffic from private traffic
- can be setup as internal or external

## General
- managed by aws

## Compatible services
- [[EC2]]
- [[EC2]] [[ASG]]
- [[ECS]]
- [[utils/ACM]]
- [[CloudWatch]]
- [[Route53]]
- [[WAF]]
- [[GlobalAccelerator]]

## Health checks
- port and route

## Classic Load Balancer
- htt, https (layer 7), tcp (layer 4), ssl
- deprecated
- health checks tcp or http based
- fixed hostname

## Application Load Balancer
- http, https , websocket (layer 7)
- need target groups
- can use to target diffrent containers on same mashine
- good for [[ECS]] and docker
- port mapping feature
- fixed hostname
- app servers dont see the clients ip directly
- cannot attach elastic ip
- cross AZ load balancing enabled by default

### Target groups
- [[EC2]] Instances
- [[ECS]] Tasks
- [[Lambda]] functions
- Private IP Adresses

### Routing
- based on path
- based on hostname
- based on query

## Network Load Balancer
- TCP, TLS, UDP (Layer 4)
- high performance, millions of requests per second
- less latency
- one static ip per AZ
- support elastic IP
- health checks with tcp, http or https
- cross AZ load balancing is disabled by default

### Target Groups
- [[EC2]] Instances
- Private Ip Adresses
- Application Load Balancer ([[ELB]])

## Gateway Load Balacher
- IP Protocol (layer 3, networkt)
- Deploy scale and manage a fleed of 3rd party netwurk viurual aplicaneces
- Examples, Firewals, Instrusion Detection, Deep Packet Inspection, payload manipulations
- GENEVE Protocol on port 6081

### Functions
- Transparent Network Gateway, single entry exit for all trafic
- Load Balancer distributes to your check mashienes

### Target Groups
- [[EC2]] Instances
- Private Ips

## Security
- uses [[SecurityGroup]]

## Sticky Session
- by default requests are spread
- can be enabled for [[ELB]] CLB and ALB
- controlled via cookie set by the [[ELB]]
- might bring imbalance to the nodes

### Cookie Types

#### Application based  custom cookie
- generated by the target
- can include any custom attributes
- cookie name is set in target group
- dont use AWSALB, AWSSALBAPP or AWSSALBTG, there are reserved for use by ELB

##### Application cookie
- generated by ELB
- Cookie name is AWSALBAPP 

#### Duration Based Cookies
- generated by ELB
- name AWSALB or AWSELB for CLB

## Cross AZ Load Balancing
- distributes evenly across all az instances
- if not enabled distributes evenly across all az but not instances
- ALB always enabled no extra cost
- NLB disabled by default cost extra
- CLB disabled by default can be enabled no extra cost

## SSL/ TLS
- ELB uses x.509 cert
- can use AWS Certificate Manager ([[utils/ACM]])
- can upload own certificales
- required for https listener
- can add multiple to support multiple domains
- can modify securitty policy to support older versions of SSL

### SNI (Server Name Indication)
- clients can use this to specify the hostname they reach
- how do you load multiple certs on on server to serve multiple https website on one server
- client indicateds hostname of the target server in inital handshake
- only for ALB or NLB or [[Cloudfront]]

### CLB
- only one ssl cert
- must use multiple clb if multiple domains via https

### ALB
- multiple listeners with multi ssl certs
- SNI

### NLB
- multiple listeners multi certs
- SNI
- used for routing tcp traffic (e.g. ssh)

## Connection Draining/ Deregistration Delay
- Time to complete in flight request while instance is going to be no longer targetet by ELB
- between 0 to 3600 seconds, default is 300
- low value if requests are short

### Launch Template
- AMI
- Instance Type
- [[EC2]] User Data
-  [[SecurityGroup]]
- SSH Key Pair
- [[IAM]] Roles for the EC2
- Network and Subnets information
- ELB Information 
- min max size
- scaling policies

### [[CloudWatch]] Alarms
- monitor metic and scale out or in

### Scaling Policies

#### Cooldown period
- Afer scaling no other scaling can be done for a period
- default 300 seconds
- allows metrics to stabilized
- use AMIs to launch instances faster and use less cooldown period

#### Good Metrics To Check
- CPU Utilization
- Request Count per Target
- Average Network io
- Any custom metric via [[CloudWatch]]

#### Dynamic Scaling

##### Target Tracking
- i want cpu to stay around 50%
- no cooldown period

##### Simple Step Scaling
- when cpu > 70 add 2 && when cpu < 10% remove 2

##### Scheduled Actions
- based on time

#### Preditive Scaling
- Analyse historical load
- ML
- hands of approach
